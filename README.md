# filter
A multi-parameter filtering app. Select a dataframe pkl where the event names and properties are saved and an hdf5 where the data can be found.
Plot events against one another to see clusters.
Select points in the scatter plot to divide the whole set of events and decide which ones to keep.
Use the event plot to peek at the event selected and work out which classes of event go where.
